# Who’s This For?
* People with any device running iOS 16.0-16.6.1 who don’t have support for [Dopamine](https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-dopamine/) or [Palera1n](https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-palera1n/) looking for the next-best ‘jailbreak’ experience

# Initial Setup

1: Install TrollStore following [this guide](https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-trollstore/)

2: Install Bootstrap

* Copy link of .ipa file on the OFFICIAL repos latest release here: [https://github.com/roothide/Bootstrap/releases](https://github.com/roothide/Bootstrap/releases)
* Open TrollStore
* Select the add function (+ in top right)
* Paste the link of the ipa file & install

3: Bootstrap

* Open the bootstrap application
* Select ‘Bootstrap’

4: Install ElleKit in Sileo

* Tip: If sileo won’t open, re-open bootstrap first and make sure the server is running
* If I must elaborate further, you probably shouldn’t be here right now

5: Install serotonin and ‘jelbrek’

* Perform step 2 again but with the latest serotonin here: [https://github.com/mineek/Serotonin/releases](https://github.com/mineek/Serotonin/releases)
* Make sure you are still bootstrapped (check the bootstrap ui)
* Open the application and ‘jelbrek’
* Perform userspace reboot if prompted
* If your device repeatedly crashes during this process, re-bootstrap and increase your ‘memory hogger headroom’ in Serotonin settings and try again (personal fix worked for my 14 pro)

If all went to plan, you should now see the ‘Confidential and Proprietary’ text across the bottom of your homescreen

# Re-breking

The process is semi-untethered, meaning once everything’s installed, you won’t need a computer to reinstall anything, but each time you reboot your device, you will have to re-bootstrap and re-jelbrek.

* 1: Bootstrap
* 2: Jelbrek
* 3: Re-open bootstrap (ensure server is running)

# Quick Tips

**Q: ‘I don’t see my installed tweaks in (application_name_here)'**

A: You must enable tweak injection on a per-application basis following these steps: 
* Bootstrap > App List > Enable your app
* Bootstrap > Settings > Rebuild Apps

**Q: Sileo says 'Not Updated: You can contact the developer of this package...'**

A: RootHide Patcher explained here, but you can also fix it yourself, or wait for the original dev to update it
*Note: This will **NOT** work for every package, and for those that it will, you will likely still not achieve 100% functionality*
* Install the RootHide Patcher
* Select 'Convert' when prompted upon attempting to install incompatible package
* If the package was originally rootful, patch using 'Directly convert simple tweaks'
* Else if the tweak was made for rootless environment, patch 'using rootless compact layer'
